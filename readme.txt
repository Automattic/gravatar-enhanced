A bunch of groovy enhancements for using Gravatars on your site, made by the same people who make Gravatar.

== Description ==

Gravatar Enhanced adds some cool features to your site:

* Enable <a href="https://blog.gravatar.com/2023/10/02/new-gravatar-hovercards-faster-open-source-and-everywhere/">Hovercards</a>
* Send customized Gravatar invitation emails to commenters on your site that don't have one!
* Toggle a `referrerpolicy` on avatars for enhanced privacy
* Force all avatars to match your default style

You can enable and manage the features from the "Discussion" Settings page. Just look for the "Avatars" section.

This is an official release from Gravatar and we will be bringing more new features here.

== Automatic Installation ==

1. Click 'Add New Plugin' from your WordPress plugins page and search for 'Gravatar Enhanced'
1. Press the 'Install Now' button
1. Activate the plugin
1. Go to the "Discussion" Settings page to enable the new features.

== Manual Installation ==

1. Download the plugin from https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravatar-enhanced/
1. Upload and extract the plugin to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the "Discussion" Settings page to enable the new features.

== Usage Tracking ==

The plugin has an opt-in usage tracking feature. If enabled this will send Gravatar some data about how the plugin is used, which is used to help us make the plugin better.

This data is anonymous and does not include any site or user information. It only sends the following information:
- What Gravatar Enhanced options have been used
- If a profile is updated via the Gravatar card

== Screenshots ==

1. Hovercards!
